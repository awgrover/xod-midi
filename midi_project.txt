can you provide information on how to code the arduino to use something like:
https://www.ebay.de/itm/MIDI-Shield-Musical-Breakout-Board-Instrument-Digital-Interface-Adapter-Plate/272750438796?hash=item3f8131698c:g:HJUAAOSwN2VZXafh
I'm also looking at https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-shield-hookup-guide
----
shields, etc., choosing ports
softwared serial: other pins
	#include <softwareserial.h>
	SoftwareSerial Serial8n9(8,9);
	MIDI_CREATE_INSTANCE(SoftwareSerial, SoftSerial, MIDI);
	// sparkfun midi shield can be software-serial, not sure exactly
----
** serial event
** MIDI.turnThruOff();

likes note-name-to-note-number
"note" should be on & off
	propose simple note-on-off
	duration is derived
	button driven is derived
		on/off
* published
	change to awgrover/
ccontrol change
	controller #
	channel
	change v
	* rotary encoder....
	* defaults?
	Button is derived (on fall edge, minimal debounce)
	variant
		!change #, but:
		bank lsb, bank msb, change #
program change
	x,y
	bank select is important
Bank Select(msb,lsb, pc) appears to be:
	control-change #0,v:msb
	cc #32, v:lsb
	then a pc
	
pitch-bend
* should I validate channel? 1..16
	values? 0.127 usually
* Does note need a "sent" output?
	a sent-play
	a sent-stop
	why? you always have a stop-pulse
* naming: "bank-program-change" || with "program-change" (sort)
	are msb/lsb usually documented in hex?
* "soft-thru" is broken

---
I "published" my x-midi library. It is `awgrover/x-midi`. Get it with "Add Library".

* Added control-change
* Added program-change

---

* update wiki design notes
* note-name-to-# is useful
	want enum
* discuss tempo more
			
Figure out the midi shield
	how to pick it
	https://www.ebay.de/itm/MIDI-Shield-Musical-Breakout-Board-Instrument-Digital-Interface-Adapter-Plate/272750438796?hash=item3f8131698c:g:HJUAAOSwN2VZXafh
	
beats could be a diff set of nodes
	
maybe:
	channel is serial #....
	

	
"manual" serial pins -- any arduino

Write a library that can construct midi commands and send them. flow control?
Just Serial.write(somebinary)

e.g. https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/Midi

A library -- all arduino
https://playground.arduino.cc/Main/MIDILibrary
callback->tree invoke
a check-for-anything every loop or so: Midi.read()
* interferes w/standard usb programming (& console)
* can use softwareserial or hardware Serial2...

Complete? Usable?

What about the midi-usb lib?

Hardware like
https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/midi-shield-hookup-guide
?

dox said:
note on/off
program change from buttons  no lag!
control change from pots
filter midi messages
	type of messges, etc

so.

install the FortySevenEffects/arduino_midi_library
	* run arduino-ide
	* sketch:manage-libraries
		MIDI Library by Forty Seven Effects
	* create a link (shortcut) from xod's library to the arduino-ide
		# linux
		sudo ln -s ~/Arduino/libraries/MIDI_Library /opt/XOD IDE/resources/arduino-libraries
		# windows:
		???

	MIDI.setHandleNoteOn(doSomeStuffWithNoteOn);
		various signatures
		sethandleControlChange(& f(byte channel, byte number, byte value))
		MIDI.disconnectCallbackFromType(midi::NoteOn);
	A node for the type of thing: handleNoteOff
	inputs: enable/disable
	with outputs byte channel, byte note, byte velocity & pulse
Filtering
	a note, condition, out

Pattern 1
	config object, 1 of them
	nodes use ambient MIDI
Pattern 2
	each node has an input for which Serial
Pattern x
	multiple config items
	each node has a config input (int->&)
	
XOD Pattern
	0. an object manages it: Serial2, neopixel-pin9, neo10
	1. the global can optionally take some args
	2. requires a heartbeat (at <<baudrate/8 )
	3. multiple instances of the object, indicate which object to a node
	4. non-atom data: notes, Serial2, lists...
	5. enums in/out (actually UI label->value, like select/option) eg. Serial1|2|..., MidiControlChangeNumber
